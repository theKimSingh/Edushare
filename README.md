# Quadrant Resources Internship Project
A team of 5 created a full stack webapp with technologies including React, Node, SQL, tested via Docker, and deployed to a CI/CD pipeline that was hosted on Azure. The idea was to create a nonprofit for sharing educational supplies among students. We presented this to our mentors along with data visualized using PowerBI and got 1st place in our mini-competition among other interns.
